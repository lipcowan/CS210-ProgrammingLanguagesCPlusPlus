## Airgead Banking Application

The focus of the project was to create an application that demonstrates the power of investing and compound interest that is geared toward students.

I think that the user interface went well on this project for the specifications that were provided. I would have preferred to create a better front end but the front end spefications were followed mostly to a t. 

There were a few issues with looping through and the prompts not restarting where I wanted them to, that ended up being an issue with one or two lines that I needed to move up in the hierarchy. Overall I think the code is clean, easy to read, and hopefully easy enough to expand upon if needed.
